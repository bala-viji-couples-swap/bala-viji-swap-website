# bala-viji-swap-website

**GitHub:** https://github.com/bala-viji-couples-swap/bala-viji-swap-website.git  

Adult (18+) **static multi-page site** for **Vijayalakshmi (age 25)** and **Bala** — Chennai couple-swap / mangalsutra-wife character world. Dark red & black erotic UI.

The site is built as a **house of rooms** (not one endless scroll): photos first, then explore hubs (Her / Us / Him / Nights / Looks), long story chapters, chats, and dated nights.

> **For Grok CLI / any AI agent:** Read this file fully before editing. No build toolchain. Open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder statically.  
> **No rates, no prices, no booking CTA** — story, gallery, and couple lore only.  
> **No site audio** — sound features were removed by owner request.

## Navigation (site-wide rooms)

Primary nav on most pages:

**Gallery · Looks · Her · Us · Him · Nights · Story**

| Room | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Home | `index.html` | Trailer: look first, then doors into the house |
| Gallery | `index.html#gallery` | Photos (before marriage + wife collection) |
| Looks | `looks/index.html` | PG / mall / silk / red / saree / mangalsutra costumes |
| Her | `her.html` | Hub into letter, looks, photos, chats, story, nights |
| Us | `us.html` | Couple dynamic, sharing, what they hide |
| Him | `him.html` | Bala’s handler notes (training, control, swap) |
| Nights | `nights.html` | Open nights + **sealed** teasers + daily secret |
| Story | `index.html#story` + `stories/` | 16-chapter arc previews + full pages |
| Letter | `letter.html` | Linked from Her (and home CTAs historically) |
| Chats | `index.html#chats` | Fake leaked phone threads (not live chat) |

---

## Home page flow (`index.html` — in order)

1. **Age gate** — 18+; `sessionStorage` key `viji_age_ok`
2. **Confession ticker** — rotating lines under nav
3. **Hero** (`#top`) — Ken Burns background; CTAs → photos / nights / her room
4. **Tonight’s secret** + **Explore us** room doors (`#explore`)
5. **Gallery** (`#gallery`) — photos first (“look first, read later”)
6. **Posters** (`#posters`) — EN + Tamil texted art, lightbox
7. **Desire** (`#about`) — who she is + stats (age **25**)
8. **Chats** (`#chats`) — Origin / Training / After highway phone UI
9. **Nights she was given** (`#swap-record`) — dated couple-swap diary 2022→2026
10. **Story** (`#story`) — accordion previews + “Read full chapter →”
11. **Sex video** (`#videos`) — **one** video feature; `assets/videos/*` are stills from that single clip; set `data-stream` on `#video-feature` when host URL ready
12. **Find us** (`#contact`) — Instagram + X + Pinterest (no booking rates)
13. **Footer** — 18+ notice + social links

## Explore features

### Tonight’s secret
- Element: `#tonight-secret-text` on home and `nights.html`
- Logic: `js/main.js` → `initTonightSecret()`
- One erotic line per **calendar day** (stable for that day, rotates over a list)

### Sealed nights
- On `nights.html` — dashed “locked” cards with blur/tease copy
- Not empty placeholders: unfinished hooks so visitors return
- Unlock by writing the real night and moving card to open list + home diary

### Looks (costumes)
| Page | Vibe |
|------|------|
| `looks/pg-girl.html` | Pre-thali, PG room soft |
| `looks/mall-pink.html` | Public tease, shopping high |
| `looks/silk-hotel.html` | Purple slip, hotel |
| `looks/open-invitation.html` | Red top, open pose |
| `looks/saree-wife.html` | Maroon silk traditional |
| `looks/mangalsutra-slut.html` | Wedding gold / shared wife |

### Fake chats (`#chats`)
Styled phone UI only — **not** live messaging. Tabs:
- **Origin** — Instagram / first kiss era  
- **Training** — Telegram PG nights  
- **After highway** — post first paid night  

### Nights diary tone
Use erotic language in UI labels (not tech jargon):
- Prefer “Nights she remembers” over “Session log”
- Prefer “Things her body learned” over “Badges / seals unlocked”

## JS behaviors (`js/main.js`)

| Function | Role |
|----------|------|
| `initAgeGate` | 18+ gate, `viji_age_ok` in sessionStorage |
| `initNav` | Mobile menu + scroll state |
| `initSmoothScroll` | `[data-scroll]` anchors |
| `initLightbox` | Gallery / look image viewer |
| `initReveal` | Scroll-in animations |
| `initChapters` | Story accordion + expand/collapse all |
| `initChats` | Fake phone thread tabs |
| `initTicker` | Rotating confession bar |
| `initTonightSecret` | Daily secret line |
| `initVideos` | Sex video cards + modal player (`data-stream` URL) |

### Sex video (`#videos`) — single clip

- **One video only.** Files in `assets/videos/` (`clip-01` …) are **stills/frames from that same video**, not separate clips.
- Feature card: `#video-feature` with `data-stream=""` (paste host/mp4 URL later)
- Clicking stills changes the hero poster frame
- Play opens `#video-modal` — stream if set, else still + “not linked yet”
- xHamster title/description options: `xhamster-titles-descriptions.txt` (written for **one** upload)

When the stream is ready:

```html
<!-- on #video-feature in index.html -->
data-stream="https://your-host.example/path/video.mp4"
```

---

## Local preview

```bash
cd /path/to/bala-viji-swap-website
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

Prefer `http://` serve over `file://` so relative paths and lightbox behave consistently.

## Customization cheat sheet

| Want to change… | Edit… |
|-----------------|--------|
| Age (keep **25** unless owner says otherwise) | Stats on `index.html`, story copy, this README |

| Home section order | `index.html` section blocks |
| Tonight’s secret lines | `js/main.js` → `initTonightSecret()` secrets array |
| Sealed / open nights | `nights.html` (+ full diary on `index.html` `#swap-record`) |
| Handler notes | `him.html` |
| Couple / her hubs | `us.html`, `her.html` |
| Looks | `looks/*.html` + `looks/index.html` |
| Full story chapter | `stories/NN-slug.html` + preview in `#story` |
| Story accordion | `js/main.js` → `initChapters()` |
| Fake chats | `index.html` → `#chats` |
| Hero image | `css/style.css` → `.hero__bg` background URL |
| Age-gate copy | each page’s `#age-gate` (or shared pattern) |
| Nav rooms | nav block on each HTML page (keep in sync) |

## Deploy (Cloudflare Pages)

Cloudflare Workers/Pages **asset files must be ≤ 25 MiB**.  
If the build fails on something like:

```text
.git/objects/pack/pack-….pack … 28.4 MiB
```

the deploy root is including **`.git`**. Do **not** publish the repo root as assets.

### Required Pages settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Framework preset | **None** |
| **Build command** | `bash cloudflare-build.sh` |
| **Build output directory** | `dist` |
| Root directory | `/` (repo root) |

`cloudflare-build.sh` copies only site files (`*.html`, `assets/`, `css/`, `js/`, `looks/`, `stories/`, `tv/`) into `dist/` and **excludes `.git`**.

Also present:
- `.assetsignore` — extra ignore list for Workers static assets
- `.gitignore` — ignores `dist/`, `pasted-text.txt`, etc.

### Direct upload (no Git build)

Upload **only** the contents of `dist/` after running:

```bash
bash cloudflare-build.sh
```

Never zip/upload the folder that still contains `.git`.

---

## Agent instructions (Grok CLI)

1. **Read** this README + relevant HTML before large rewrites.  
2. Keep **age = 25** (current) unless the user explicitly changes it.  
3. **Do not re-add** booking, rate cards, cost tables, Telegram CTA, or site audio unless the user asks.  
4. Prefer editing existing files over adding frameworks/npm.  
5. New pictures → `assets/pictures/` + markup; **no spaces** in filenames.  
6. Do not remove the 18+ age gate.  
7. Story: keep `ch-01`…`ch-16` on home; full pages under `stories/`; update this README table if chapters change.  
8. Keep nav rooms consistent across `index.html`, hubs, `letter.html`, `looks/*`, `stories/*`.  
9. UI labels for nights/couple lore should stay **erotic/story-toned**, not tech jargon (“session log”, “badges”, etc.).  
10. Sanity-check: age gate → Explore doors → gallery lightbox → chats tabs → full story chapter prev/next → nights sealed cards → tonight’s secret text present.

---

## TV party reel (unlisted)

**Path:** `/tv/` → `tv/index.html`  

**Not linked** from main nav or explore rooms (on purpose).

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `tv/index.html` | Fullscreen party screensaver start + stage |
| `tv/tv.css` | TV-optimized dark UI |
| `tv/tv.js` | Slide builder, autoplay, keyboard, shuffle |
| `tv/images.json` | JSON catalog (optional fallback) |
| `tv/images-data.js` | **Embedded catalog** (`window.TV_IMAGES`) — preferred loader |

**Behavior:**
- **Portrait** images → **3 per slide**
- **Landscape / wide** → full slide (or pair if two medium-wide)
- Auto-advance ~7s, shuffle, optional auction caption lines
- Keyboard: `←/→` slides, `Space` pause, `F` fullscreen, `C` captions
- Image list loads from `images-data.js` (no fetch required — fixes `/tv` without trailing slash)

**Regenerate image list after adding photos** (requires Pillow):

```bash
# from repo root
python3 -c "
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
import json
root=Path('assets/pictures'); ext={'.jpg','.jpeg','.png','.webp'}
P,L=[],[]
for p in sorted(root.rglob('*')):
    if p.suffix.lower() not in ext: continue
    w,h=Image.open(p).size
    item={'src':'../'+p.as_posix(),'w':w,'h':h}
    (P if h>=w*1.05 else L).append(item)
data={'portraits':P,'landscapes':L}
Path('tv/images.json').write_text(json.dumps(data,indent=2))
Path('tv/images-data.js').write_text('window.TV_IMAGES = '+json.dumps(data)+';\\n')
print(len(P),'portraits',len(L),'landscapes')
"
```

**Private auction tip:** serve the site (`python3 -m http.server 8080`), open `http://localhost:8080/tv/` (trailing slash preferred), start reel, press **F**. Unlisted on purpose. No blackout controls.

**Keep screen awake:** `tv.js` requests **Screen Wake Lock** when the reel starts (and re-requests on tab focus). Silent video fallback if Wake Lock is missing. **Smart TV panel sleep** is still set in the TV’s own menu (Sleep timer / Eco / Auto power off → Off) — browsers cannot always override that.

---

## Product intent (for future features)

- **Goal:** never-ending *exploration* (many rooms), not infinite scroll.  
- **Hooks:** photos early, secrets that change, sealed nights, couple triangle (her / him / us), long story depth.  
- **Avoid:** rate menus, generic porn that breaks Viji face continuity, dumping everything on one page.
